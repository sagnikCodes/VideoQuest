    "description": "After media reports, Pakistan has officially broken its silence on the Joint Investigation Team (JIT) probe into Pathankot terror attack. Pakistan has said that it is studying the evidence provided by India. However, it added that the JIT could not interrogate Indian witnesses related to security issues.\n\n\nAAJ TAK was launched in December 2000 as a 24-hour Hindi news channel, which covers India with insight, courage and plenty of local flavour. Within six months of its launch, AAJ TAK emerged as India\u2019s number one news channel. And within eleven months, it was awarded the best news channel by the India Television Academy. Two years on, it bagged the Indian Television academy\u2019s award for being \u201cThe Best News Channel\u201d again, and added the RAPA award for \u201cBest Advertising Campaign\u201d. Beginning with an impressive connectivity of 5.2 million homes at the time of launch, AAJ TAK today boasts of a reach of over 30 million homes and a channel share of more than 55% among the news channels. Its unique style of passionate story telling and live coverage has become its hallmark.\n Follow us:\nYouTube: https://www.youtube.com/user/aajtaktv?sub_confirmation=1\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/aajtak",
