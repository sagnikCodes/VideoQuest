One was injured and he is in utter shock,\" he said.The bodies have been brought back to unit area, he said.\n\nAsked whether Pakistan's Border Action Team (BAT) was involved in the attack, he said it was carried out by the troops of 2 PoK Brigade, which is deployed in that sector.\n\nFor More information on this news visit: http://www.itvnewsindia.com/\nConnect with us on Social platform at: https://www.facebook.com/ITVHindi\nSubscribe to our You Tube channel: https://www.youtube.com/user/itvnewsindia",
