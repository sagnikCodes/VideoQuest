    "description": "On Prime Time, we take a look at how the country is living through the absence of 500 and 1000 Rupee currency notes which the government pulled out on Wednesday. With a massive scarcity of currency to perform large transactions, how are wholesale markets continuing to trade? Why are traders afraid of performing electronic transactions?
